# VNTextMiner

Ever get annoyed having to constantly switch between your game and a browser just to look up a word? You're deep in a Visual Novel, you hit a Kanji you don't know. You Alt-Tab out to find it, add it to anki, tab back in, and your immersion is gone.

**VNTextMiner** solves this. It is a streamlined, standalone overlay tool designed specifically for Japanese learners. It sits transparently over your game, monitors your clipboard (via Textractor, Game2Text, or OCR), and provides a modern, **Yomitan-style popup** right on top of the action.

## ✨ Features

*   **Universal Clipboard Monitoring:** Works with Textractor, Game2Text, OCR, or just simple Copy+Paste.
*   **🧠 Smart Anki Integration:**
    *   **Duplicate Detection:** Dictionary headwords turn **Green** if the word is already in your Anki deck.
    *   **Context Aware:** Prevents accidental duplicates while allowing heteronyms (same Kanji, different reading).
*   **📸 Auto-Screenshots:**
    *   Automatically captures the game window when you mine a card.
    *   **Smart Compression:** Resizes and compresses images to prevent Anki freezing or database bloat.
*   **Yomitan-Style Popup:** 
    *   **Lazy Loading:** Instant popup rendering with zero lag.
    *   **Rich Data:** Pitch accent, frequency data, and stacked Furigana.
    *   **Clean Formatting:** Exports HTML-styled lists and badges to Anki (looks just like Yomitan).
*   **Overlay Features:**
    *   **Transparency Slider:** Blend the overlay seamlessly into your game.
    *   **Click-Through Toggle:** Hide the UI when reading, show it when mining.
    *   **Modern UI:** KonoSuba-inspired aesthetic with dark mode support and custom scrollbars.
